# Team CloudBase - NBA Data Analysis

# Goal
To take a data set and extract useful and relevant team information from it. We plan to use this information to predict game winners as well as display team statistics. A little ambitious yes, but differently useful. We plan to give our best shot on a problem that has not been solved yet.
